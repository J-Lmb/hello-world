# hello-world
My first repository 

This is my first GitHub experience. It's inevitable that the computing world will require you to have a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.

I will start commiting my codes from my various private projects and make them available to the public. On the other hand, I will have my group projects both professional and personal.
